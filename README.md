# Decidim::SimpleUi

This component's purpose is to clean up Decidim version 0.28's (and up) UI and make it simpler.
SimpleUi doesn't affect Decidim's logic, but keeps the UI simplified and closer to what Decidim was
in the previous version 0.27.

## Usage

SimpleUi will be available as a Component for a Participatory
Space.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-simple_ui", github: "mainio/decidim-module-simple_ui"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```
